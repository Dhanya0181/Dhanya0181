ðŸ‘‹ Hi Everyone, Iâ€™m @Dhanya.
I am a graduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering with a minor in Machine Learning. I embarked on my journey in the world of electronics with a deep curiosity for how things work. Throughout my academic years, I honed my skills in Digital System Design and Embedded Systems.

My journey into the realm of Machine Learning began when I realized its potential to transform industries. I'm passionate about Embedded Machine Learning/TinyML. I am interested in leveraging AI to create smart, data-driven solutions that can make a positive impact. 

In the coming years, I aim to further deepen my expertise in Embedded Systems, Machine Learning and TinyML. I'm excited to contribute to cutting-edge projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in these fields. My ultimate goal is to be at the forefront of creating intelligent, connected systems that benefit society.
